<h1 id="resource-budget-analysis-example">Resource Budget Analysis Example</h1>
<p>This example illustrates weight analysis, electrical power analysis, and computer hardware budget analysis.</p>
<h2 id="doing-the-analysis">Doing the Analysis</h2>
<p>Start by instantiating both:</p>
<ul>
<li>System Impl MySystem.Tier0 &nbsp; -- includes weight and power</li>
<li>System Impl MySystem.Tier2 &nbsp; -- adds processor and bus</li>
</ul>
<p>Do this by right clicking on the appropriate system implementation in the Outline view and selecting &quot;instantiate&quot;. If it doesn&#39;t already exist an &quot;instances&quot; folder will be created in the project with the two instances ending in .aaxl2.</p>
<p>All of the analyses in this example are accomplished by right clicking on one of the instances and selecting &quot;Analyses&quot; from the dropdown menu and then selecting the desired analysis under &quot;Budget&quot;. All of these analyses produce results in either comma delimited or Excel files (or both). The Problems tab will also show issues in the analysis.</p>
<p>The OSATE help system has documentation that is useful for this example. Navigate from the Help menu to Help-&gt;Help Contents-&gt;OSATE Core Documentation. Open that up and then open Model Analyses and select Other Analyses. There you will find more information about each of the analyses in this example.</p>
<h3 id="weight-analysis">Weight Analysis</h3>
<p>To do a weight analysis select &quot;Calculate Weight Totals&quot; as the analysis method. The results will appear in a &quot;WeightAnalysis&quot; folder within the &quot;Instances&quot; folder. The bottom line of the analysis report for the tier0 instance should show:</p>
<p><em>MySystem_Tier0_Instance: [A] Sum of weights (2.760 kg) is below weight limit of 3.000 kg (8.0 % Weight slack)</em></p>
<p>The Problems tab will show three warnings which can be ignored as they have to do with weight limits of abstract items as shown in the report.</p>
<p>The report for the tier2 instance should show:</p>
<p><em>ERROR:  MySystem_Tier2_Instance: [A] Sum of weights (3.360 kg) exceeds weight limit of 3.000 kg</em></p>
<p>The analysis shows that the selected components are too heavy given the systen requirements. This error also shows up in the Problems tab.</p>
<h2 id="electrical-power-analysis">Electrical Power Analysis</h2>
<p>Use &quot;Analyze Power Requirements&quot; to do this analysis and the results will appear in the &quot;Power&quot; folder within &quot;instances&quot;. For the tier0 system, the bottom line of the resulting report says:</p>
<p><em>budget total 2.5 W within supply 40.0 W</em></p>
<p>and there are no entries under the Problems tab.</p>
<p>For the tier2 system, the report will say: </p>
<p><em>budget total 4.1 W within supply 40.0 W</em></p>
<p>with two warnings in the Problems tab that are inconsequential.</p>
<h2 id="computer-hardware-budget-analysis">Computer Hardware Budget Analysis</h2>
<p>Because the tier0 system does not contain processor or bus information it is only profitable to run this analysis on the tier2 system. Here is a summary of what should result.</p>
<h3 id="bus-load">Bus Load</h3>
<p>While the tier2 system specifies bus bindings, it does not specify a budget for either of the pci or canbus bus. The result of running &quot;Analyze Bus Load&quot; is:</p>

<h3 id="not-bound-resources">Not Bound Resources</h3>
<p>The result of running &quot;Analyze Resource Budget (Not Bound)&quot; on the tier2 system is a .csv report that includes errors:</p>
<p><img src="./doc/tier2_not_bound_resource_report.png" alt="png"></p>
<h3 id="bound-resources">Bound Resources</h3>
<p>The result of running &quot;Analyze Resource Allocation (Bound)&quot; on the tier2 system is a .csv report that includes an error:</p>
